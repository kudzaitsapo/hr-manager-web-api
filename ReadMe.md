# HR Manager Web API

### What the hell is this?
This is an API for an HR Management project. It was developed using ASP.Net Core with Entity framework

### Why an HR Management system?
No good reason actually. I actually found the Employees schema online, and it makes it easier to develop a system from there. In simple terms, I didn't want to think too much about a schema ... (lol)

### How do I run it?
Normally I'd advise people to download Visual Studio and run the solution from there. However, if you're not privileged with internet access (haha) or you have linux, then at least you need dotnet core and SQL Server installed. If you've got those already installed, then you probably don't need me to tell you how to run the code. If you don't ...

### What if I fail to run it?
There are a few possibilities:
- You didn't change the connection string
- You didn't run the migrations
- You don't have DotNet Core and SQL Server installed, in which case I can't help much.
